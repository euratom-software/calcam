Calcam Changelog
================

Patch Release 2.8.3 (01 Apr 2022)
---------------------------------

* Fixed a bug in the 3D viewer tool which raised exceptions when enabling/disabling CAD model features with 1 or more calibrations loaded but un-checked.


Patch 2.8.2 (26 Mar 2022)
---------------------------------

* Fixed a bug in the image analysis tool which caused exceptions to be raised when toggling image save options in the "Position Analysis" tab.


Patch 2.8.1 (15 Feb 2022)
---------------------------------

* Fixed a bug when using the image movement tool to adjust points within the fitting calibration tool, when loading a new image. Points which moved outside the image area were not being updated, when in fact they should be removed.


Minor Release 2.8.0 (10 Feb 2022)
---------------------------------

New & Enhancements:
* Added ability to render un-folded image of tokamak interior on to a rectangular image (render.render_unfolded_wall() and available through 3D Viewer GUI)
* Added ability for ray-casting to calculate the CAD model surface normal vectors where sight-lines intersect the CAD model, these are now stored in RayData objects.
* Added option to show camera fields of view as shading of the CAD model in the 3D Viewer GUI
* When loading calibrations with multiple sub-views in to the 3D Viewer GUI, the appearance of the field of view for each sub-view can now be changed independently.
* Display of 3D coordinate data loaded in to the 3D viewer GUI can now be much more customised (showing as lines / points, line width & marker size adjustment, legend support)
* Layout of the movement correction GUI has been re-organised.
* Image analyser GUI can now show an image mapped on to the CAD model surface in its 3D view.
* Image analyser GUI can now apply colour-maps to loaded gresycale images.
* Image analyser GUI now supports applying movement correction to a loaded image for more accurate results.
* Layout of displayed position information in the image analyser GUI has been improved
* Image analyser GUI now supports saving images.
* When loading a new image in the fitting calibration tool, there is now a prompt to use the movement correction tool to quickly adjust all calibration points at once.
* In the fitting calibration tool, image enhancement options in the main window are now also applied in the sub-view definition editing dialog.
* CAD overlays in the fitting calibration tool are now always rendered at 1 megapixel or greater resolution, even for low resolution images being calibrated. (#74)
* Added additional options to customise display of the CAD overlay image in the fitting calibration tool (can be wireframe or solid CAD; adjustable opacity).
* Added "undo" function to fitting calibration tool which can undo up to the last 20 changes to the calibration point coordinates. (#75)
* When saving the current view in the 3D viewier tool, any legend displayed in the window is now included in the output image.

Compatibility Updates:
* Now compatible with PyQt6
* Changed dependency in setup.py from opencv-python to opencv-python-headless to reduce likelihood of problems with OpenCV vs PyQt version conflicts. (#72)
* Restricted versions of VTK installed by setup.py to avoid issues with newer versions of VTK (see #78)

Fixes:
* On Windows, stopped separate VTK error output window opening to show VTK warnings.
* Fixed bug in Image analyser which could cause exceptions when loading images in display orientation.
* Fixed bug where image enhancement was unexpectedly turned off (but the checkbox stayed checked) when editing sub-view definitions in the fitting calibration tool
