Calcam Changelog
================

Changes on master branch since last release
-------------------------------------------

Fixes:
* Fix bug in Calibration.set_detector_window() which raised exceptions for calibrations with multiple sub-views


Patch 2.6.1 (08 Dec 2020)
-------------------------

Fixes:
* Fix exception raised by Calibration.set_detector_window() for some combinations of calibrated and set detector windows.
* Fix spurious update notifications when using development versions.


Minor Release 2.6.0 (05 Dec 2020)
---------------------------------

New & Enhancements:
* Allow setting of detector window using Calibration.set_detector_window() for multi sub-view calibrations if the requested window is not entirely overlapping with the original.
* Enable direct opening of .ccc files by passing the filename to the Calcam GUI executable.
* Change references to "perspective" lens model to "rectilinear"

Fixes:
* Roll back changes to render_cam_view() made in v2.5.0 because they break rendering for images with multiple sub-views.
* Fixed bug in version checking logic so the upgrade message is not shown when using the master branch version.
* Fix bug in coordtransformer() in image size checking logic which would cause erroneous errors about expected image size (possibly related to #56).
* Properly format docstrings in coordtransformer.py
* Enable rendering with oversampling and original coords (previously raised an exception saying not supported)
* Fix bug in CoordTransformer.original_to_display_shape() and display_to_original_shape() where the pixel aspect ratio was ignored.
* Fix a bug which raised an exception and prevented loading saved geometry matrices with newer versions of NumPy.
* Replace exception raised when saving an empty alignment calibration with a friendlier dialog box.
* Fix pop-up of VTK error window when closing Calcam GUI on Windows.
* Fix Calibration.subview_mask not being restored properly when resetting detector windowing using Calibration.set_detector_window(None) (Issue #60)
* Fix image cropping not working properly in Calibration.set_detector_window() if the requested window is bigger than the original calibration.
* Fix un-paired 3D cursors being added when importing point pairs from a calibration with a bigger readout window.
* Fix exception raised when loading a new image in to a calibration with multuple sub-views (by keeping subview mask when loading new image)


Minor Release 2.5.0 (22 Jul 2020)
---------------------------------

New & Enhancements:
* Improved brightness scaling of images with >8 bits per pixel to give better image display for high bit-depth images.
* Added new keyword arguments "exclusion_radius" and "intersecting_only" to raycast_sightlines() (#49) (see documentation for details)
* Add options for specifying original or display coordinates and ROI offset when loading image files.
* Improve setup script messages for more user-friendliness
* Improve introductory documentation, mainly installation guide / dependencies.
* Possibly slightly increased the speed of render_cam_view()

Fixes:
* Fix a bug which raised exceptions when loading calibration sight-lines in to the 3D viewer
* Fix exception raised by raycast_sightlines() if no CAD model features are loaded
* Fix bug where split field calibrations did not always load properly in the fitting tool
* Fix exceptions raised in the point fitting tool if changing split-field definition with point pairs already defined.
* Fix exceptions raised in image analyser when loading an image before a calibration
* Fix several bugs in the CAD model editor which raised exceptions and/or resulted in broken .ccm files.
* Image analyser now correctly updates wireframe overlays when selecting or deselecting CAD features or loading images with different detector windows
* Fix issue where cursor position information was not updated when creating a new point in the fitting calibration tool.
* Remove now unnecessary (I think) setting of matplotlib backend which could cause crashes on import if using matplotlib > 3.2.
* Change setup.py to avoid installing VTK > 8.2 (workaround for issue #58)


Patch 2.4.1 (08 Jan 2020)
-------------------------

Fixes:
* Fixed long-standing issue with corrupted CAD model rendering on some unix systems (#55). Requires QtOpenGL submodule of PyQt to be available (otherwise falls back to previous behaviour).
* Fixed issue where image enhancement made some images look much worse (#51).
* Fixed camera roll angle entry not working properly in CAD model editor (#54).
* Fixed bug where after turning on the axisymmetric wall contour display in the 3D viewer, it could not be turned off again (#52).
* Fixed bug where the detector window information was not loaded properly when loading calibrations in the fitting tool, which led to exceptions when loading point pairs from other calibrations, and possibly other errors.

New & Enhancements:
* Added display of QtOpenGL module availability to the system information in the Settings dialog box, for troubleshooting rendering issues.


Minor Release 2.4.0 (06 Nov 2019)
---------------------------------

New & Enhancements:
* Vastly improve treatment of detector sub-windowing: added Calibration.set_detector_window() and RayData.set_detector_window() methods
* Implement support for detector sub-windowing in image analyser
* Implement adjustment for different detector windowing when loading point pairs from existing calibrations in fitting tool
* Add optional arguments to enhance_image() to enable or disable enhanecement steps. This allows better image detail retention when enhancing low pixel count images.

Fixes:
* Fixed a bug in fitting calibration GUI where an exception could be raised when points were cleared.
* Fixed a bug in 3D viewer GUI which would raise an exception after editing the name of a 3D line not currently selected.
* Fix image transforms in CoordTransformer to work with arrays with non integer dtypes, provided the camera pixels are square.
* Fixed a bug when loading calibrations with no detector window offset stored (i.e. from older Calcam versions) which caused exceptions in set_detector_window().
