--------------------------

Fixes:
* Replacing a mesh file with one of the same filename in the CAD model editor no longer results in a broken .ccc file.
* Fix default 2D array flattening order in GeometryMatrix being different from NumPy's default (resulted in transposed images).

* Fix image rendering from 3D viewer GUI always rendering in display orientation regardless of selected settings.
* Fix re-arrangement of model features between groups in the CAD model editor not being saved.

---------------------------

Fixes:
* Fix bug raising exceptions from raycast_sightlines when using status_callback=None.


Patch 2.2.1 (25th Feb 2019)
---------------------------

Changed:

Minor Release 2.2.0 (25th Feb 2019)
---------------------------------

New & Enhancements:
* Replaced undocumented geometry matrix functionality in calcam.geometry_matrix with new calcam.gm module and add corresponding documentation.
* Re-written setup script with better dependency handling (checks presence and tries to use PIP to get them) and better messages. Update docs accordingly.

Fixes:
* Fix bug where loading chessboard images in the fitting calibration tool would cause an exception.
* Fix bug where calcam.gui and matplotlib could try to use different PyQt versions leading to exceptions.

* Fix loading of calibrations with intrinsics constraints in fitting calib tool (previously intrinsics constraints disappeared)
* Fix incorrect number of point pairs reported when using another calibration for intrinsics constraints.
* Various typo fixes and minor tweaks in docs
* Fix a bug in CoordTransformer which resulted in strange image point types in transformed pointpairs objects, leading to exceptions


Bug fix release 2.1.2 (5th Feb 2019)
------------------------------------

Hot on the heels of yesterday's serious bug...another!

Fixes:
* Change explicit check for OpenCV major version == 3 to major version > 2, for compatbility with OpenCV 4.


Bug fix release 2.1.1 (4th Feb 2019)
------------------------------------

Fixes:
* Performing a fit in a newly created calibration raises an exception


Minor Release 2.1.0 (18 Jan 2019)
---------------------------------

New & Enhancements:
* Add Calibration.get_undistort_coeffs() method (Issue #24)
* Add ability to customise the colour of the wireframe overlay including transparency in fitting tool (Issues #31 & 25)
* Add fallback method for histogram equilisation if OpenCV hist eq unavailable, and adjust OpenCV Hist Eq parameters (Issue #25)
* In fitting tool, the current points, fit and display are preserved when loading another image of compatible dimensions (Issue #30 + general improvement)
* Add ability to load another calibration for overlay comparison in fitting tool (Issue #32)
* Add ability to specify camera extrinsics by roll instead of upvec in Calibration.set_extrinsics() and also add check that upvec and viewdir are orthogonal.
* Add ability to manually specify source directory in Calcam 1.x file converter
* Various GUI appearance enhancements for non-Windows OSs.
* Added friendlier error message if permission denied trying to save a file.

Fixes:
* Fix bug in Calcam 1.x file converter which caused fit results not to be converted properly.
* Fixed incomplete reset of GUI state when resetting the fit (Issue #30)
* Fix mesh files not being loadable in the CAD model editor under python 2.x
* Fix incorrect classification of "user code" in exception handling
* Add QVTKRenderWindowInteractor.py to Calcam distribution to work around compatibility issue with VTK + PyQt5 as distributed with Enthought Canopy.
* Fix exceptions when opening calibrations not containing images.



Bug fix release 2.0.1 (18 Dec 2018)
-----------------------------------

Fixes:
* Fixed bug in CAD model editor causing exceptions when removing model features which had been moved between groups.
* Fixed CAD model editor often spuriously reported that there were unsaved changes to the CAD model.
* Fixed reloading of user coordinate formatter in CAD model editor hitting recursion limit.
* Fixed missing "Are you sure" prompt when removing viewports in CAD model editor.
* Fixed some GUI elements not being reset properly when un-loading a model in the CAD model editor.
* Changed exception raised in CAD model editor when loading UTF8 encoded data to a friendlier message.
* Fixed exceptions raised in calibration tools when loading calibrations if the CAD model has a different set of features than expected.
* Fixed checked features in CAD model feature tree becoming out of sync when loading calibrations.
* Fixed bug which could cause CAD model definitions to be corrupted if they did not close cleanly.
* Fixed undesirable behaviour which caused 1 broken CAD definition file to stop all others being detected.
* Fixed bug where custom coordinate formatters were not properly reloaded when reloading CAD models (can cause exceptions in some circumstances).
* Minor typo fixes
* Added missing image + notes on user code structure in documentation



Calcam v2.0.0 (16 Dec 2018)
--------------------------------

New major version with many API, GUI and file format changes.

See full documentation pages for notes on upgrading from Calcam 1.x.



Bug fix release 1.9.4 (06 Nov 2018)
-----------------------------------

Fixes:
* Fixed bug causing unhandled exceptions when opening GUI with no CAD models set up (e.g. on first run)



Bug fix release 1.9.3 (11 Mar 2018)
-----------------------------------

Fixes:
* Fixed bug in loading legacy CSV format fit files under Python 3.6
* Fixed string formatting in exception handling under Python 3.6
* Fixed bug when checking if "Do Fit" button should be enabled which caused exceptions when loading some previously used images.
* Fixed image points disappearing when loading a different image of the same shape when they should be persistent.



Bug fix relase 1.9.2 (21 Feb 2018)
----------------------------------

Fixes:
* Fix inaccurate rendering in render_cam_view() for images with the centre of perspective not at the image centre (as far as I know this bug has existed since the very earliest versions of Calcam, but only now been noticed).
* Only enable "Do Fit" button in calibration tool when there are enough points that OpenCV won't raise an exception.



Update to 1.9.1 (18 Feb 2018)
-----------------------------

Fixes:
* Fixed exception raised when clicking "Apply" in the split field definition dialog.
* Fixed zoom not working properly in split field definition dialog.
* Fixed broken field mask behaviour when using 2-point split-field definition (and greatly simplify algorithm in the process).
* In point fitting calibration tool, fixed various GUI elements with text being cut-off due to being too narrow.
* Fixed a bug where performing some image geometrical transformations would cause the image to move off-centre in the window.
* Hard code version string in __init__.py; the way I did it before was stupid.
* Fixed bug where the numbers of paired and un-paired points was not being reported correctly.
* Fix off-by-1 issue when converting between VTK and image coordinates (effects point pair calibration and image analyser).

New & Enhancements:
* Make RayCaster class available in the root of the calcam package instead of only in calcam.raytrace.
* Switch to Sphinx for documentation. The documentation is not yet complete, but it's no less complete than it was before.
* Tweaks to launcher GUI including displaying calcam version in the window title
* Update GUI window titles
* Whether or not the 'Do Fit' button is enabled is now decided a bit more cleverly depending on how many fit parameters are enabled.

Removed:
* Removed unused exclude_feature_edges and include_feature_edges arguments in calcam.render.render_cam_view()



Release 1.9.0 (15 Feb 2018)
---------------------------

Fixes:
* Various fixes to mouse interaction (juddering, not recognising button-up etc)
* Many other bug fixes (see commit messages)

New:
* Add setup script
* First version with a proper release tag, and add __version__ attribute to package
* Actually start using Changelog somewhat properly
