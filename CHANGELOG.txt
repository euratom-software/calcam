Calcam Changelog
================


Future Patch Release 2.9.1
--------------------------

Fixes:
* Fixed bug which caused the Settings GUI to fail to open under PyQt6 in some circumstances.
* Fixed bug in RayData class where getting a data array from a Raydata object loaded from disk could produce garbled results.
* Fixed exception raised by QVTKRenderWindowInteractor in PyQt6 if QGLWidget is not available.
* Fixed (hopefully) invalid .zenodo.json so future releases get successfully published on Zenodo.
* Try to save a little memory by adding de-registration of ZipSaveFile.close() method from atexit when the file is closed.


Minor Release 2.9.0 (17th July 2022)
------------------------------------

New & Enhancements:
* Calcam now available on PyPi (but could use improvements to make distribution more PEP compliant in future) (#83)
* Support masking of images (i.e marking parts of the image which do not contain any actual image) in fitting and manual alignment calibration tools (#46).
* Add vertical field of view input in virtual calibration editor as an alternative to focal length (#85).
* Remove error message if fitting determines the camera is upside-down; camera roll not settable in range -180,180 instead of -90,90 degrees.
* In the virtual calibration editor, hide pinhole model parameters if another intrinsics type is selected (otherwise could be misleading).
* In the virtual calibration editor, when using intrinsics from an existing calibration, display the filename of that calibration.
* Add button to save image to use as a template for creating image masks.
* Add ability to place a default configuration file in the calcam directory which will be checked for new users on multi-user systems.
* Version number is now stored in 1 place (calcam/__version__) instead of 3 different places.
* Re-work setup.py for compatibility with PyPi and pip.
* Make handling of missing dependencies smoother & error messages more helpful (hopefully), including raising ImportWarnings at import instead of print statements.
* Try to improve documentation for installation & setup.
* Change new version update prompt link from linking to code archive to linking to the relevant doc page.
* Improve image quality and status printing in render_unfolded_wall()
* Added function GeometryMatrix.unformat_image() to do the inverse of format_image(). This is convenient to have when using the new masking functions.

Fixes:
* Fix issue where setting the 3D CAD view to match a calibration result set the camera roll inaccurately.
* Fix a bug which caused invisible wall coverage shading on some platforms (#86).
* Fix an exception raised in the CAD definition editor when deteling model variants in a new CAD model definition (#87).
* Fix exception raised when opening calibration info box with PyQt6 (#88)

* Fix a bug in the virtual calibration editor where changing intrinsics type did not enable the correct set of options.
* Fix a bug where the virtual calibration editor would prompt to save changes even with no CAD model loaded.
* Fixed a bug where the "new version available" prompt could be shown incorrectly.
* Fixed a bug in 3D viewer where loading a calibration while "CAD model shading" view type was selected raised an exception.
* Fixed an issue which sometimes caused exceptions from MatPlotLib if plotting a tomography grid without data.
* Fitting options no longer reset for no reason when changing image masking in fitting calibration tool.
* Fix an exception raised when pressing Alt+Shift keys together over VTK views.
* Replace exception raised in image analyser if the image window metadata does not match calibration with a more helpful error message.
* Fixed an issue where the CAD model definition editor would not recognise a path was in the Calcam config even when it was.

* In the fitting calibration tool, image enhancement options in the main window are now also applied in the sub-view definition editing dialog.
* CAD overlays in the fitting calibration tool are now always rendered at 1 megapixel or greater resolution, even for low resolution images being calibrated. (#74)

* Added "undo" function to fitting calibration tool which can undo up to the last 20 changes to the calibration point coordinates. (#75)
* When saving the current view in the 3D viewier tool, any legend displayed in the window is now included in the output image.

Compatibility Updates:
* Now compatible with PyQt6
